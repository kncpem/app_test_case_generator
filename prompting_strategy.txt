Prompting Strategy
I have used multi-shot prompting: giving the modoel multiple examples of the input and output cases for it to understand how to perform task.

Prompt Components:

1. Input Definition
Specified what the input given to the model would be
- A screenshot of a specific page of app
- Optional context that gives additional info of the ss.

2. Output Structure
It consists the explaination and structure of test cases.
a. Test Case ID: A unique identifier for each test case.
b. Test Case Description: A description of the test case and what functionality it is validating.
c. Pre-Conditions: The necessary conditions before running the test.
d. Test Steps: The detailed steps the tester should follow.
e. Test Data: Any necessary input data for the test (e.g., valid/invalid login credentials).
f. Expected Result: The expected outcome of the test case.
g. Post-Condition: Any cleanup required after running the test.
h. Actual Result and Status: Fields to be filled during actual test execution.

3. Examples for the input and output:
Example 1: test cases for the login page
Example 2: test cases for the seat selection page
Example 3: test cases for the payment page
These multiple examples provide the model with a variety of input scenarios and their corresponding outputs, which helps the model generalize and generate correct test cases when a new screenshot and context are provided.
